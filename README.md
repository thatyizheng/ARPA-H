# ARPA-H
 The repo contains codes and steps for running external tracking systems for Imaging Modalities Registration (CT/MR and Ultrasound).
 The final output will be Ultrasound and CT/Phantom in Endoscope Coordinate System, i.e EN_to_US and EN_to_CT.
 The transformations will be sent to Jake's stereo overlay program.

# Things DO NOT have yet
1. Phantom from Sam Streeter

2. The CT scan of the Phantom (need segmentation and .stl model generation)

3. Marker Positions on both Phantom and its .stl

4. Calibration Plate's .ROM file

5. Butterfly Plate's .ROM file

6. Transformation between Endoscope Coord System and Butterfly Plate Coord System
