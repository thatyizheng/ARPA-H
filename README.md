# ARPA-H
 The repo contains codes and steps for running external tracking systems for Imaging Modalities Registration (CT/MR and Ultrasound).
 
 The final output will be Ultrasound and CT/Phantom in Endoscope Coordinate System, i.e EN_to_US and EN_to_CT.
 
 The transformations will be sent to Jake's stereo overlay program.
